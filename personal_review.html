                <p id="answer">If I could rename the book I would call it "colored cast of the aparthied", which will
                    reflect
                    the impacts of
                    the aparthied on the author of the book, and although the aparthied is over , the world "casts of"
                    reflects
                    the reminant of the belief. </p>

        <h3>"Abel wanted a traditional wife... but he never fell in love with subservient women... 'He only wants a
            woman who is free because his dream is to put her in a cage."</h3>
        <p id="answer">This quote from the book reflects the complex interaction of the society to gender roles and the
            difference
            between the traitional expectations and the modern personal freedom. Trevor's step father Abel's desire to
            have a traditional wife while desiring to put her in cage reflects the contradictory expectations that exist
            with in a relationship. the longing for a woman who is free and idependent but his actions being controling
            and demanding reflects the societal expectations of the gender roles.<br>In modern society, there is
            still a conflict between gender roles and that of the old traditional expectations. Women are
            expected to be independent, assertive, and smart in many parts of the world, yet a lot of men still expect
            women to conform to traditional roles of being bounded and submission in relationships. This contradiction
            is
            visible not only in romantic relationships but also in work and public life, where women’s role is often
            undermined by society to conform to gender norms.<br>
            The idea of wanting someone who is free, yet desiring to cage them, mirrors real-life power struggles. It
            speaks to men who may say they support women’s independence but at he end of the day want to control them in
            some
            wether it is emotionally, financially, or socially. This speaks about the undeniable truth in today’s
            society
            even in the age of equality, many women still face the burden of balancing their independence with societal
            expectations of submission.
            I’ve seen this in relationships around me, where partners may claim to support equality but impose
            outdated gender roles. The challenge, therefore, is not just about women fighting for their freedom, but
            also about men recognizing that true freedom for both partners is not about control but mutual respect and
            understanding.
