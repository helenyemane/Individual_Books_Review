        <strong> "Abel wanted a traditional marriage with a traditional wife… but he never fell in love with subservient women… 'He only wants a woman who is free because his dream is to put her in a cage.'”</strong>
<p>
    It does resonate with historical and better understanding of the genders' roles in some cultures and relationships.
    In tradition womens were expected to be submissive to their husbands do home chores and respect their husbands.The quote shows how men like Abel wants independent women 
    so that they can confine them on relationship attention.
Abels desire for traditional marriage with a traditional woman shows the troubling perspective on relationship.
It shows historical beliefs that women should be under men and there was no women should go against their husband.<br>
I recall a video where husbands' words are laws while womens are opinions are rarely valued.This reflects a societal structure that Abel seems to be interested in.
For me a true partnership thrives on mutual respect and the freedom for both individuals to grow and express themselves.The idea of one partner being dominant that the other suggests lack of trust and desire of the power over connection.
According to me Abel want to  have Patricia due to  hunger of egoistic hence  want to control a woman who is known to be independent throughout the book by boosting his own power.It reflects  Abel’s insecurities when he is in a marriage 
for example he even breakdown Patricia’s car so that she and Naoh could not travel or visit their families.<br>
Noah repeatedly highlights Abel’s jealousy and desire to control Patricia he didn’t want  her to have friends from outside and her own life.
Abel want one person who was easy controlled by temper and controlling nature.
Most of the instances in the book Abel abuse Patricia both verbal and physical abuse where she even to the authority to report but no help she gets because she is just a woman.The book subtly yet powerfully underscore
how societal structures,often perpetuated by men in power can create an environment 
were women value is not valued since Patricia’s resilience becomes a testament  to the enduring spirit of women fighting against confinement forces.
